The date format "2025-01-30" follows the ISO 8601 standard, which is written as YYYY-MM-DD (Year-Month-Day).

- YYYY = Year (2025)
- MM = Month (01 = January)
- DD = Day (30)
This format is widely used in scientific, technical, and international contexts because it is unambiguous and easily sortable in chronological order. It is the preferred format for databases, programming, and data exchange standards.
